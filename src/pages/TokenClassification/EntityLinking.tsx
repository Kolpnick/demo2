    <p>
      Entity Linking is the task of linking named entities mentioned in the text
      with their corresponding entities in a database. This task usually
      consists of two steps: first, named entities (persons, organizations,
      locations, etc.) are recognized and extracted from the text, then a
      relevant record in the database (in our case itâ€™s Wikidata) is searched
      for each extracted entity. To learn more on implementation read our{" "}
